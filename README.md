**Proto** is a fast-paced game where players must "shoot" at crystals to prevent them from breaking through their perimeter walls.

## About Proto

The main goal of the game is to prevent the crystals that are spawned at the center from breaking through the walls and leaving the edge of the screen. 
If they breakthrough, you will lose a heart, losing all your three hearts results in you losing the game. 

### Game Mechanics

1. **Shooting Crystals:** Aim and left-click on the sphere surrounding the crystals to shoot and damage them.
2. **Collecting Crystal Fragments:** Right-click on the fragments to collect them and charge your power bar.
3. **Spell Casting:** Combine different colored fragments in your power bar to cast spells. Valid combinations include:
   - Red, Red, Red: Destroys all non-red crystals.
   - Blue, Blue, Blue: Slows down time.
   - Green, Green, Green: Zooms out the camera.
   - Blue, Green, Red: Makes walls invincible.
   - Red, Green, Blue: Revives dead walls.
4. **Survival Mode:** See how long you can hold off crystals from breaking through your defence.
