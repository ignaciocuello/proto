###### C# code for proto project

The main goal of the game is to prevent the crystals (that are spawned at the center of the screen) from breaking through the walls and leaving the edge of the screen. 
If they breakthrough, you will lose a heart, losing all your three hearts results in you losing the game.

This game uses mouse and keyboard. Left click is used to “shoot” a crystal and deal a single point of damage. Right click is used to collect crystal fragments that are dropped when they die. In order to “shoot” a crystal the sphere around them must be clicked. Collecting crystal fragments fills up your power bar with colors, your bar has 3 slots, when your bar has a valid spell signature (such as red, red, red) if you press space bar you will cast that spell. The valid spell signatures are as follows:

- Destroy all non-red crystals: red, red, red
- Slow down time: blue, blue, blue
- Zoom out camera: green, green, green
- Make walls invincible: blue, green, red
- Bring back dead walls to life: red, green, blue
- It is recommended to take the tutorial before playing survival mode.

Proto was originally made in 2018

note: I've only included the C# files in the repository as the project takes too long otherwise to upload. The assets I've left out are not programming related (mainly art assets).
